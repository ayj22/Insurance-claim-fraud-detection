# Insurance-claim-fraud-detection
In this project we have built machine learning model and Predicted if the customer will do fraud in insurance claim or not!
In this notebook we are going to apply Python based Machine Learning algorithms/model of predicting if the customer taking claim is doing fraud or not.

Step by step road map:

Step 1: Defining the problem statement
Based on all the given attributes can we predict if the customer claim is fraud or not.

Step 2: Data
We have downloaded the data from kaggle. Source : https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/insurance-claim

Step 3: Evaluation
Our bentch mark for this model is to achieve atleast 80% accuracy to pursue the project further
